## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + React + Nanostores project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
│   └── components/
│       └── UserForm.jsx
│       └── UserTable.jsx
│   └── store/
│       └── user.js
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
